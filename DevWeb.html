                    <h2>Whats this website about? We are the Clueless Coders</h2>
                    We are a group that  meets in the basements of libraries of Philadelphia. The Clueless Coders combined with over 30 years experience, (and as little as 4 months experience) 
Are all together for a common good. To make learning to code and improving one's programming capabilities to the next level. We thrive on hard work and perserverance; and most of all common sense. All are welcome to our group who have the willingness and ability to not only survive in Software Development-- yet to thrive to our ultimate potential.  We all have the same 24 hours in a day. It is up to us as individuals to determine what type of life we want to live.   ---- need to pull this just off the top of my head
                    <p>This website is being created by Anderson and Matt Overstrom. Anderson created at Meetup group called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Philadelphia-Intellectual-Discussion-Meetup-Group/?success=coverphoto?success=coverphoto" target="blank">Aspiring Self-Taught Software Developers</a> in September 2019. Anderson and Matt met during a meetup and they and a few other aspiring programmers decided to branch off and make another programming group called Clueless Programmers. This group meets twice a month and has about five other members. Anderson and Matt decided to build a website for our groups on the suggestion of one of our mentors within the Clueless group, Will. </p>
